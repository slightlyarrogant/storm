The project is being undertaken by a collaboration of Polish companies, including MESKO S.A. and CRW Telesystem Mesko, alongside the Ukrainian enterprise DerzhKKB Luch. This collaboration leverages the strengths of domestic industry to bolster Poland's military readiness.\n\nOne of the key technological innovations in the Pirat project is the development of a gyroscopically stabilized guidance head, which is crucial for achieving accuracy and effectiveness in various operational scenarios. This guidance system, along with an advanced autopilot developed in cooperation with DerzhKKB \u201cRay,\u201d allows the missile to maintain stability and precision during flight, enhancing its effectiveness against armored targets (Sources [1], [4]).\n\nThe missile system includes a semi-active guidance mechanism and is designed to be adaptable for use in both regular operational units and the newly formed Territorial Defense component. The project has considered two variants, Pirat-1 and Pirat-2, which share several common components, including the guidance system, further optimizing production and operational efficiency (Source [6]).\n\nIn addition to direct targeting capabilities, the Pirat system's integration with the Perun unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) enhances its operational versatility. This integration allows for the engagement of targets not only through the Pirat missile but also enables the guidance of precision munitions from other platforms, including artillery and drones, by reflecting laser guidance (Source [3], [9]). This multifunctional approach significantly amplifies the tactical options available to Polish forces in combat situations.\n\nThe introduction of the Pirat missile system, as part of the PUSTELNIK program, signifies a strategic move to upgrade Poland's anti-tank capabilities in light of contemporary security challenges. This modernization effort aligns with the Polish Ministry of Defence's goals to improve overall military effectiveness and readiness against potential threats (Source [8]). \n\nOverall, the technological innovations introduced through the Pirat project not only enhance the Polish Armed Forces' anti-tank defense but also represent a critical step towards more comprehensive military modernization through collaboration with domestic and international partners.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1727782341, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_f85bea6784", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 455, "prompt_tokens": 968, "total_tokens": 1423, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0}}}, "raw_kwargs": {}}

Janusz Noga was a member of the product development team working on the GROM portable anti-aircraft missile system, and its subsequent modernizations, resulting with the PIORUN missile\n[2]: Polish companies CRW Telesystem-Mesko and PCO have completed work on a qualitatively new laser illumination and guidance system for the anti-tank guided missile Pirat.\n[3]: The TELESYSTEM-MESKO Development and Implementation Center has developed a mobile MSR KUSZA anti-aircraft system. The creators' assumption was to create a system consisting of an off-road platform capable of carrying up to 6 GROM/PIORUN missile launchers along with a day and night tracking and firing system.\n[4]: Polish-made Pirat ATGM Anti-Tank Guided Missile. (Picture source Army Recognition) The Pustelnik program was launched by the Polish armed forces to acquire new anti-tank weapon systems to cover the gap between the anti-tank grenade launchers, and heavier ATGMs (Anti-Tank Guided Missiles), such as Spike-LR, or the Brimstone missiles that would be the primary weapon in the Ottokar-Brzoza program, an anti-tank combat vehicle.\n[5]: Pirat meets the requirements and expectations expressed by the Polish Armed Forces multiple times, within the context of the Pustelnik program for instance, where Pirat remains the primary solution that is offered by us.\n[6]: The Armament Agency announced that 7 entities have submitted their proposals to participate in preliminary market consultation, concerning the deliveries of the Pustelnik ATGM - both domestic, as well as foreign ones. ... The list is as follows, as provided to us by the Spokesman for the Armament Agency Krzysztof P\u0142atek: ... LIG Nex1 Co., Ltd. ... Raytheon Missiles & Defense Co., with Lockheed Martin Co.\n[7]: The PAC-3 missile is a new interceptor, featuring a Ka band active radar seeker, employing \"hit-to-kill\" interception, in contrast to previous interceptors' method of exploding in the vicinity of the target, destroying it with shrapnel, and several other enhancements which dramatically increase its lethality against ballistic missiles. The specific information for these different kinds of missiles are discussed in the \"Variants\" section.\n[8]: Block 2 features enhanced communications systems that allow mid-course guidance correction, making the missiles easy to network into the Navy's emerging Cooperative Engagement Capability. Unlike Block 1, Block 2's active radar homing seeker supports terminal engagement without the launch ship's target illumination radars.\n[9]: In order to increase the effectiveness, the countermeasures shall be varied and interconnected and fused into a single fighting system, due to the presence of active and passive protection systems and options of tailoring the tactics of acting against a specific anti tank weaponry. The main assumption of the Pirat programme is to be in possession of high quantities of missiles and launchers that could also be utilized in order to fight against targets other than combat vehicles, such as fortifications.\n\nNow give your response.

This initiative reflects a strategic need to modernize and diversify Poland's anti-tank capabilities, particularly in the context of evolving threats on the battlefield.\n\nThe Pirat missile system has been developed collaboratively by Polish defense companies, including CRW Telesystem-Mesko and PCO. Notably, the companies have recently completed work on a new laser illumination and guidance system, enhancing the missile's targeting and operational effectiveness. The design goals for Pirat align with the expectations articulated by the Polish Armed Forces, highlighting its suitability as the primary solution offered in response to the requirements set out in the Pustelnik program.\n\nOne of the significant advantages of the Pirat system is its versatility; it is designed to not only engage armored combat vehicles but also to target a variety of other structures, such as fortifications. This broad capability is essential for modern military operations, where flexibility in targeting is often critical. The Pustelnik program aims for high quantities of missiles and launchers, emphasizing the operational need for a robust anti-tank arsenal that can adapt to various combat scenarios.\n\nMoreover, the Pirat missile system represents a qualitative leap in Poland's indigenous defense technology, demonstrating the country\u2019s commitment to enhancing its military capabilities through domestic production. This is particularly significant given the competitive landscape of military procurement, where various entities, both domestic and foreign, have expressed interest in participating in the Pustelnik program, underscoring the importance of Pirat as a contender in this market.\n\nOverall, the development of the Pirat ATGM is a critical component of Poland's broader strategy to modernize its armed forces and ensure effective deterrence against potential threats, reinforcing the country's defense posture in a rapidly changing security environment.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1727782345, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_f85bea6784", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 408, "prompt_tokens": 886, "total_tokens": 1294, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0}}}, "raw_kwargs": {}}

A significant aspect of the company's future endeavors focuses on the Pirat anti-tank guided missile (ATGM) program. This project, a collaborative effort between Mesko S.A., the Military University of Technology, and Ukrainian partner DKKB Luch, is in its final stages, with tests confirming the validity of the adopted assumptions and the practical application of R&D solutions[2].\n\nOne of the notable aspects of the Pirat program is its emphasis on developing a cost-effective and versatile weapon system. Unlike more expensive missiles guided by optical fiber or advanced optronic systems, the Pirat program aims to produce a high quantity of missiles and launchers that can target not only combat vehicles but also fortifications. This aligns with the broader strategy of integrating various countermeasures into a unified combat system, increasing overall effectiveness[1].\n\nIn addition to the Pirat ATGM, CRW Telesystem-Mesko has developed the LPC-1 laser target designator, a crucial component for the missile's operational efficiency. This laser system is NATO-compliant, ensuring its compatibility with allied fire control systems, thereby enhancing its utility in joint operations[2]. Further, the company showcased a prototype targeting and guidance unit, CLU-P, at the XXIX International Defence Industry Exhibition in Kielce, indicating ongoing innovations in this domain[3].\n\nCRW Telesystem-Mesko also leverages its extensive experience in laser and optoelectronic technologies to develop new systems for both military and civilian applications. The company's expertise spans the creation of fire control systems, laser protection systems, and advanced photodetector production technologies. These technologies are crucial for developing modern \"smart\" weapon systems, which are expected to play a significant role in future combat scenarios[5].\n\nAnother innovative direction for CRW Telesystem-Mesko is the development of unmanned armed land platforms.

It is worth emphasising that the consolidation of the military, scientific and Polish industry around the subject of combat robots is also a success. The unique knowledge gained during the project implementation allows for further development in the field of unmanned armed land platforms.\u201d Damian Jarosz, Project Manager.\nPIRAT is a light, portable short-range anti-tank missile (up to 2.5 km) self-guiding to laser radiation reflected from the target, fired from the shoulder or from a universal, modular position for detection, tracking, identification and targeting (CLU \u2013 developed by CRW Telesystem -Mesko and PCO SA), containing a tripod launcher. The system uses precise guidance of the reflected laser beam illuminating the target, which the missile attacks from the so-called \u2018upper hemisphere\u2019, which guarantees very high combat effectiveness.\n[4]\nautonomous Launch Mechanisms for launching missiles from the KUSZA MSR;\nhunting (ambush action) against targets on anticipated flight paths at ceilings of up to 4 km (aircraft, helicopters, missiles with flight speeds of up to 320 m/s (cruise missiles, anti-radiation missiles, air-to-ground missiles), unmanned aerial vehicles and other aerial targets.

One of the methods to enhance the anti tank capabilities, proposed by the experts, is to introduce a light, single purpose weapon into use, being placed between the Spike ATGM listed above and new anti tank grenade launchers which would ultimately replace the RPG-7 weapons system. Such solution, in line with the conceptual assumptions of the Pirat programme, would be significantly cheaper than the missiles guided with an optical fibre/optronic guidance system.\nIt is assumed that this weapons system is to complement both the Spike-LR missiles Poland already owns, as well as the new generation anti tank grenade launchers which are soon to be introduced. At the moment, the anti-tank capabilities of the Polish Army are based on the medium range Spike-LR anti tank guided missiles which are also expected to be integrated with the armoured combat vehicles, including the Rosomak APC and - further down the road \u2013 the new IFV.\nOne of the methods to enhance the anti tank capabilities, proposed by the experts, is to introduce a light, single purpose weapon into use, being placed between the Spike ATGM listed above and new anti tank grenade launchers which would ultimately replace the RPG-7 weapons system.

This type of missiles could be introduced into use both in the operational units, as well as within the newly formed Territorial Defence component. Two variants have been considered, Pirat-1 and Pirat-2, sharing numerous common components, including the gyro-stabilized laser guidance system.\nThe said missile could be used to neutralize machine gun stations, points of resistance, gathering points for the military units, logistics equipment, helicopters or small vessels. The technology demonstrator of the Pirat-2 missile has already gone through the initial field tests. For the purpose of providing a proper guidance measure, LPC-1 laser target illumination device has been developed too.\n[6]\nIn the presented module, it was installed above the original ZMO-1, and the final version is to use a variant of the CLU-P targeting and guidance system of the Pirat set (TELESYSTEM-Mesko, PCO SA). Laser rangefinder-designator LDP-A is also used to illuminate the target for the 155 mm APR 155 guided missiles for howitzers and the 120 mm APR 120 for mortars, as well as laser-guided precision bombs.\nThis makes it possible to become independent from the supply of this type of missiles from abroad. It also places Poland among the few countries with the production capacity of this type of military equipment.
