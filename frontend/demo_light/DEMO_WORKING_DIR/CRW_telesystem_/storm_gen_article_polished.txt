# Overview of CRW Telesystem

CRW TELESYSTEM-Mesko is a modern organization specializing in research and development (R&D) and production within the defense industry. The company has experienced consistent growth in staff and expansion of its scientific and research potential over the years. CRW TELESYSTEM-Mesko excels in transferring research results to industrial applications, producing technologically advanced equipment and devices[1].
The company's primary focus is on developing, implementing, and producing optoelectronic and electronic units for portable anti-aircraft and anti-tank systems. Notably, CRW TELESYSTEM-Mesko has developed and manufactured world-unique indium antimonide (InSb) and lead sulfide (PbS) photodetectors, specialized optics, and modern hybrid preamplifiers. These technologies are a result of extensive work on homing warheads (GSN) for Man-Portable Air Defense Systems (MANPADS), leading to the implementation of several critical technologies[1].
CRW TELESYSTEM-Mesko is also a producer of key components for the GROM and PIORUN MANPADS, specifically the coordinator with an emphasis on the optoelectronic track. This includes the globally unique InSb and PbS photodetectors and hybrid preamplifiers. Due to these advancements, the company is recognized as one of the leading producers of guidance heads for missile systems. It stands alongside major producers from Russia and the USA as one of the few serial manufacturers of detectors with exceptional parameters[2].
In addition to MANPADS, CRW TELESYSTEM-Mesko is involved in the development of the Pirat anti-tank guided missile (ATGM) system. The Pirat system has been designed to meet the requirements of the Polish Armed Forces, specifically within the context of the Pustelnik program. The LPC-1 laser target designator, a critical component for the system's effectiveness, was developed through a joint R&D project between Mesko S.A. and CRW Telesystem Mesko. The system is fully NATO compliant and features an encoded laser beam[3].
The Pirat ATGM is intended to complement the existing Spike-LR missiles in Poland's arsenal and the forthcoming new generation anti-tank grenade launchers. The system aims to enhance anti-tank capabilities by incorporating both active and passive protection systems and adaptable tactics against specific anti-tank weaponry. The Polish defense industry is working on multiple variants of the Pirat system, with Pirat-1 and Pirat-2 sharing numerous common components, including a gyro-stabilized laser guidance system[4].
Through these efforts, CRW TELESYSTEM-Mesko contributes significantly to Poland's defense capabilities, ensuring independence from foreign suppliers and positioning Poland among the few countries with the capacity to produce such advanced military equipment[5].

# History and Development

CRW TELESYSTEM-MESKO Sp. z o.o., established in 1993, emerged as a leader in the field of air defense technologies by participating in the Strategic Government Program "Modern technologies for the development of the air defence system of troops and facilities" [1]. This participation marked the beginning of its innovation journey, particularly in the design and production of critical elements of the GROM Man Portable Anti-Aircraft Missile System (PPZR GROM) [1]. The company's consistent development led to an increase in staff and expansion of its scientific and research capabilities [1].
CRW TELESYSTEM-MESKO, a modern organization, has effectively transferred research results to the industry, producing technologically advanced equipment and devices [1]. The company's top engineers have contributed significantly to defense-related research and development programs. Notable projects include the development of fire control systems for the T-55 MERIDA and PT-91 (TWARDY) DRAWA tanks, as well as the BOBRAWA and OBRA laser protection systems for these tanks [1]. Additionally, they have been involved in the construction of lasers for both military and civilian applications, developing modern technical solutions for "smart" weapons systems [1].
The initiative to create the company in 1993 was led by a team of scientists and constructors, including Professor Zbigniew Puzewicz, who had a background in the Military University of Technology and worked within the Mikroel company [1]. Professor Puzewicz also contributed to the development of a detection system for long-range ship-to-ship missiles used by the Polish Navy, enhancing the missiles' parameters and extending their service life [1]. Between 2008 and 2017, he managed teams working on development projects implemented by IOE MUT and CRW TELESYSTEM-MESKO, including the development and implementation of the UST-1 GROM/PIORUN Missile Simulation Round [1].
By 1995, the first batch of GROM missiles entered service, thanks to the collaborative efforts of various Polish design bureaus, including the Zielonka-based Military Institute of Armament Technology, the WAT Military University of Technology, and the Skarżysko Rocket Design Bureau [6]. These efforts were reportedly aided by Polish intelligence services that acquired design plans of the original 9K38 Igla missile system during the post-Soviet Union dissolution turmoil [6]. The GROM system was later improved into the PIORUN, featuring a new seeker and rocket motor, with the system designed to be operated by a single soldier [6]. The PIORUN system consists of a missile, a single-use launcher, a starting mechanism, and an on-ground power supply [6][7].
In addition to its missile systems, CRW TELESYSTEM-MESKO has also been involved in other significant defense projects, such as the PIRAT anti-tank guided missile, developed in cooperation with the Military University of Technology and the Ukrainian company DKKB Luch [3]. The PIRAT missile meets the Polish Armed Forces' requirements and is designed to fill the gap between anti-tank grenade launchers and heavier ATGMs [3][8]. The system is noted for its ability to be manufactured using domestic components, reducing dependence on foreign suppliers [5].

The company's expertise spans the creation of fire control systems, laser protection systems, and advanced photodetector production technologies. These technologies are crucial for developing modern "smart" weapon systems, which are expected to play a significant role in future combat scenarios[1].
Another innovative direction for CRW Telesystem-Mesko is the development of unmanned armed land platforms. The PERUN project, Poland's first armed robot capable of operating machine guns and the PIRAT ATGM, highlights the potential for integrating advanced weaponry with robotic platforms. This project reflects a broader trend of consolidating military, scientific, and industrial efforts in the field of combat robotics, positioning CRW Telesystem-Mesko at the forefront of this emerging technology[9].

# Criticisms and Challenges

CRW Telesystem-Mesko has faced criticism for its role in addressing the anti-tank defense capabilities of the Polish Army, which remains one of the most neglected areas in the military sector[11]. Despite ongoing analytical work and attempts to introduce new battle platforms, a generational breakthrough has yet to be achieved, raising concerns about the effectiveness and timeliness of their projects[11].
Another challenge lies in the necessity for the coordinated implementation of varied and interconnected countermeasures to form a cohesive fighting system. The presence of active and passive protection systems demands advanced tactics tailored to specific anti-tank weaponry, a complex task that the company must navigate carefully[4].
The Pirat program, although promising in terms of possessing a high quantity of missiles and launchers for diverse combat applications, has faced scrutiny regarding its alignment with allied fire control systems. While tests have been carried out to confirm the assumptions and verify R&D solutions, the project remains in its final stages, leaving some uncertainties about its full operational capabilities[3].
Moreover, the Armament Agency's announcement of seven entities submitting proposals for the Pustelnik ATGM has sparked competition both domestically and internationally. This adds another layer of complexity for CRW Telesystem-Mesko as it seeks to secure its place in the market amid strong foreign contenders like Raytheon Missiles & Defense and Lockheed Martin Co.[12].
Despite these challenges, the company has emphasized its expertise in laser technology and optoelectronics, which has been instrumental in past significant defense programs. However, ensuring the seamless integration of these technologies into current and future systems remains an ongoing challenge[1].
